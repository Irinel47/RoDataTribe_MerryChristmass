--Romanian Data Tribe - X-Mass Data Viz Challenge, December 2023--

In the 'Merry Christmas in European Languages' challenge, I delved deep into the etymology of native greetings. 

My point of focus was: "Is the origin of the greeting linked to the name of Christ or is it of pagan origin?"

The main idea expressed in several languages ​​is related to birth, creation, winter, solstice, new times, and so on (apart from those that obviously refer to Christ/God).

Unraveling the linguistic roots revealed a spectrum of origins – from ancient pagan ties within Indo-European, Latin, Norse, Germanic, and Celtic cultures to those embracing Christ's pure essence. 🌍✨
